# Iris Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a simple machine learning project for classifying Iris flowers into different species using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Load the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Preprocess the data, including feature scaling if necessary.
3. Train a KNN classifier on the dataset.
4. Evaluate the classifier's performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
5. Visualize the dataset, classification results, and decision boundaries.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries and packages:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and loading the dataset.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.

## Results
The project provides visualizations of the Iris dataset, including pair plots to help understand the data distribution. Additionally, it visualizes the decision boundary of the KNN classifier and provides a confusion matrix to assess the classification results.
